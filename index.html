    About Me
  </h2>
      <p>I am a student at the University of Central Florida and I' m studying to become a Physical Therapist. However, I do enjoy coding and hope that I can do something with it someday. I also love working with my hands so any project that involves making things, typing, or, in the case of my major, helping people overcome their injuries manually, is something that I would thoroughly enjoy doing.
